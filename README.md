Introduction
This project is a demonstration of building an Android application using Jetpack Compose. It showcases the implementation of navigation, state management, data persistence, and database operations using modern Android development practices.

Features
Jetpack Compose: A modern toolkit for building native Android UI.
Navigation: Navigate between screens seamlessly.
Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF): Ensures a predictable and maintainable state.
State Management with ViewModel: Manages UI-related data lifecycle-aware.
Room Database & SQLite: Local database for persistent storage.
Data Persistence: Save and retrieve data across app launches.
LiveData and Flow: Reactive programming components for handling data changes.
Architecture
The project follows a modern MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture which ensures a separation of concerns, easier testing, and better maintainability.

Technologies Used
Jetpack Compose: UI toolkit for Kotlin.
Navigation Component: For handling navigation.
ViewModel: For managing UI-related data.
Room Database: For local database operations.
SQLite: Database engine for data storage.
LiveData: Lifecycle-aware observable data holder.
Flow: Cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values.
Getting Started
To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
Open the project in Android Studio:

File > Open > Select the cloned project directory.
Build the project:

Let Android Studio download and set up necessary dependencies.
Run the app:

Connect an Android device or start an emulator.
Click the "Run" button.
Modules and Packages
The project is divided into several packages, each handling different aspects of the app:

ui: Contains all the composables and UI-related classes.
navigation: Handles navigation between different screens.
viewmodel: Contains ViewModel classes for managing UI-related data.
repository: Abstracts the data sources.
database: Contains the Room database and entity classes.
model: Data classes representing the applicationâ€™s data.
Screens and Navigation
The app consists of multiple screens managed using Jetpack Navigation. Each screen is a composable function defined in the ui package. Navigation between screens is managed by the NavHost and NavController.

State Management
State management is handled using ViewModel and LiveData/Flow. The ViewModel stores the UI-related data and exposes it to the composables via LiveData or StateFlow.

Database
The Room library is used for local database operations. It provides an abstraction layer over SQLite, allowing for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.

Room Database Setup
Entities: Define the database schema.
DAO (Data Access Object): Defines methods for accessing the database.
Database: The main database holder.
Data Persistence
Data persistence is achieved through Room Database and SharedPreferences. The app saves and retrieves data even after the app is closed and reopened.

LiveData and Flow
LiveData and Flow are used to handle asynchronous data streams. LiveData is lifecycle-aware and is used for updating the UI. Flow is used for more complex data operations and transformations.
